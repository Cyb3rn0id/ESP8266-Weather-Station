# ESP8266-Weather-Station
Simples Wi-Fi Weather Station based on ESP8266. Shows Temperature, Humidity, Heat Index, Pressure, Altitude, Minimum and Maxim Temperatures.
Two versions: a Server version (you connect cirectly to IP address), and MQTT version (you need an MQTT Broker and a visualizer, I use a Raspberry Pi with Mosquitto and NodeRED)
